Airport retail analytics SQL project using LAX flight data and Bulgari transactions

This project explores how flight characteristics and traveler behavior influence luxury retail spending at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Airport retail has always fascinated me because it presents a unique environment where purchasing decisions are heavily influenced by travelers’ time constraints, purpose of travel, and flight conditions. 

Drawing from my prior experience working in luxury retail at Beijing Capital International Airport, I observed that sales performance was closely tied to flight timing, delays, and whether travelers were domestic or international. In that environment, Bulgari consistently demonstrated strong sales performance compared to other luxury brands, likely due to its accessible price range and well-balanced product mix. Seeing these patterns firsthand sparked my curiosity about whether similar dynamics would exist in a different market.

This experience directly motivated me to investigate how a Bulgari store at LAX might perform. By combining flight departure data with transaction-level retail data, this project analyzes how flight conditions and traveler profiles influence purchasing behavior, with the goal of uncovering insights that could help airport retailers optimize inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies.
